I'll analyze the OrgCheck score rules from the code and create a clear table explaining all 58 rules. Let me extract the information from the provided code.I've created a comprehensive table that explains all 58 OrgCheck score rules from your code. The table includes:

**Key Information for Each Rule:**
- Rule ID (0-57)
- Clear English description 
- Category classification
- Specific Salesforce artifacts/components targeted
- Detailed explanation of what the rule checks
- Simplified formula logic

**Rule Categories Breakdown:**
- **Useless** (14 rules) - Components serving no apparent purpose
- **Security** (10 rules) - Security configuration issues
- **Code Quality** (8 rules) - Apex development best practices
- **Dependencies** (4 rules) - Orphaned or problematic dependencies
- **Documentation** (4 rules) - Missing descriptions/documentation
- **Hard-coded URLs** (4 rules) - Hard-coded Salesforce domain references
- **User Adoption** (2 rules) - Users not following modern practices
- **API Version** (2 rules) - Outdated API versions
- **Overuse** (2 rules) - Resource capacity concerns
- **Hard-coded IDs** (1 rule) - Hard-coded Salesforce record IDs

The rules focus heavily on identifying unused/unnecessary components (24% of rules) and security configurations that need attention (17% of rules). This aligns with OrgCheck's mission to help organizations maintain clean, secure, and well-documented Salesforce environments.

Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific category or provide additional analysis of particular rules?

## Key Insights

- **Most Common Issues**: Useless components (24% of rules) and Security configurations (17% of rules)
- **API Versioning**: Rules check for components older than 3 years
- **Code Quality Focus**: Strong emphasis on Apex best practices and test coverage
- **Security Priority**: Comprehensive password policy and access restriction validation
- **Performance Considerations**: Rules identify potential performance impacts (deep role hierarchies, complex flows)

*Total Rules: 58 (IDs 0-57)*
